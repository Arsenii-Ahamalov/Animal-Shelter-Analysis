# Animal-Shelter-Analysis
This project involves the analysis of data from an animal shelter in Texas, USA. The datasets intakes.csv and outcomes.csv contain records of animals admitted to the shelter and those that left, respectively, between October 1, 2013, and October 6, 2024. The intakes.csv dataset includes data on animals admitted during this period, while the outcomes.csv dataset tracks animals that have left the shelter (adopted, returned to owners, etc.). This analysis focuses on understanding trends in shelter intakes and outcomes, addressing data complexities such as animals returning to the shelter and duplicate entries, and provides insights into shelter operations and animal welfare.
